## Description
Through an API call to the Hacker News service, the latest 10 news regarding the tech world are displayed when the page loads.
The news titles, authors and publication date are displayed as well as a link that allows you to open the news.
Thanks to a "Load more" button you can view the details of the next 10 news items

## Technologies - Webpack, Axios, Lodash
The application was created with Webpack.
For the API calls I used the AXIOS library with the get() method.
To get the data from the API request object I used the Lodash library with the _.get() method.

## How to Install
To open the project you only need a browser and an internet connection.
